# This checklist serves as goals I wish to complete with regards to my framework

1. Spritesheets / sprite animations (2D)

2. Physics utility (2D first)

3. Collision utility (sphere-to-sphere, AABB)

4. Mouse interaction (clicking on objects, buttons)

5. Camera improvements & mouse movement

6. Text rendering / UI basics

7. 2D bouncing ball simulation (test physics + collisions + input)

8. Make 2D game using the library

9. Texture atlas support for 3D models / tinyobj loader

10. 3D model animations

11. Make 3D game using the library

12. Compile framework into .so / .dll

13. Upload games to GitHub

14. Publish games on itch.io

# Project Phases:

Phase 1 – Core Utilities: Arena allocator, math, transforms, mesh/texture/shader helpers, input wrappers.

Phase 2 – Optional High-Level Utilities: Sprite sheets, 2D animations, text rendering, collision/physics helpers.

Phase 3 – Demonstration Projects: Small 2D and 3D demos to show the framework in action.

Phase 4 – Distribution: Compile library, document API, GitHub release, optional itch.io demos.
